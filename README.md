This is Nathan's example documentation for 22.03

1. Either clone this repository, or download/extract the .zip to your local directory. 
2. Modify the source code in markdown (especially index.html, about.html, and week-1/index.html)
3. For week-2, you can just (locally) copy and rename the week-1 folder, then edit the index.html file inside the new folder.
